# scraping-mars

This is a Flask-based web scraping app project I wrote last year using Splinter and Beatuiful Soup.  The web app visits a number of sites that feature daily information about NASA's Mars research, such featured images or news about the Rover, with the click of a button.  It then compiles that information in a MongoDB and renders an output in basic HTML.  Although this code needs a bit of updating to run presently (soon to come).
